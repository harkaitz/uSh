# uSh

uSh (Micro Shell), is a small interpreter with a syntax similar to Tcl/Tk. Is
written in pure ANSI C and can be easily extended. I wrote this program to
improve my skills programming in C.

[Source Code in Github](https://github.com/harkaitz/uSh)

The prebuilt binaries can be found in [dist](dist) directory.

## Features

uSh has a very simple syntax. You can check it's syntax reading the example
files; `src/ushc-test` 

- It supports flow control; `if,else,elif,while,foreach,for`
- Basic arithmetic;         +,-,...
- Custom functions;         `proc,exec`
- Variables;                `set`
